# Autosave toggle C4D

Sometimes when your scene is getting huge and you have autosave enabled in your Preferences
it might freeze Cinema 4D while autosaving.
So this plugin is just a little button to quickly enable or disable the Autosave option in your Preferences by just one click.
Also the plugin's icon shows the actual status of autosave option when Cinema 4D is loaded up.

Installation:

1. Download Autosave.zip
2. Unzip them to your C4D plugins folder
3. Enjoy

Tip: Add the plugins to your favorite palette via "Customize Commands... (Shift+F12)" Take a look at the Autosave_example.png file
