# Autosave toggle C4D

Sometimes when your scene is getting huge and you have autosave enabled in your Preferences
it might freeze Cinema 4D while autosaving.
So plugin is just a little button to quickly enable or disable the Autosave option in your Preferences by just one click.
Also the plugin's icon shows the actual status of autosave option when Cinema 4D is loaded up.
